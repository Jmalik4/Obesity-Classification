# Obesity-Classification
Objective: Developed a machine learning solution to classify obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition using a dataset from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.
Key Highlights:

1) Conducted comprehensive EDA and feature engineering on a dataset with 2,111 entries and 17 attributes, enhancing model accuracy by identifying key predictors like physical activity and dietary patterns.
2) Built and optimized multi-class classification models using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree algorithms, achieving a final test accuracy of 89% with a pruned Decision Tree.
3) Visualized class imbalances and model performance using advanced metrics (e.g., F1 score and confusion matrix) to identify areas for future model improvement.
   
Impact: Insights from the model could inform early intervention strategies to mitigate obesity-related health risks.
